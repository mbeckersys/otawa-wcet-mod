====== ARMv5T ======

This package provides ARM v5 T implementation based on GLISS v2 tool suite.
It contains tools and libraries to decode, disassemble and simulate
ARM v5 T executable in ELF format.

===== Configuration =====

The configuration of the built tool suite is contained in file ''config.mk''.
If it doesn't exist, just copy it from ''default.mk''.
By adding or removing comment tag ''#'' in front of options.

of GLISS v2 may be tuned in variable ''GLISS_PREFIX'' of ''Makefile''.

To compile this package, just:
	> make all


===== Content =====

Once the compiled is successful, the following tools are available:
  * disasm/arm-disasm -- disassembler,
  * sim/arm-sim -- functional simulator,
  * lib/libarm.a, include/arm -- library and header files providing decoding, simulation and disassembly of ARM v5 T binary.
