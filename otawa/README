Hey Martin, have a look at tricks.md ;)

====== OTAWA Builder ======

This package is not OTAWA itself but the script used to generate
an OTAWA distribution. Basically, the only think to do is to run
the ''build.sh'' script with:

<code sh>
./build.sh
</code>

And the script will donwload and compile automatically all dependencies
required to build OTAWA. Notice that this script works only for
Linux or Unix users.

Before launching the script, notice that the following dependencies are required:
  * C and C++ compiler,
  * Python,
  * OCAML,
  * GNUMake,
  * CMake,
  * libxml2-dev,
  * libxslt1-dev,
  * Mercurial,
  * Bazaar,
  * Flex,
  * Bison.

As a result, this script produces a package named ''otawa-core-''...
that you can unpack anywhere to get a working version of OTAWA
(no relocation procedure is needed, just maintain the relative position
of programs and libraries).

The obtained directory will contain:
  * ''bin/'' -- programs (feel free to add it to PATH),
  * ''lib/'' -- libraries and plugins,
  * ''include/'' -- header files,
  * ''share/Otawa'' -- documentation, scripts, etc.
