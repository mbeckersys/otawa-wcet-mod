# ogensim
Generic cycle-accuarte ISS for ARM-ish platforms. Does not attempt to model
any specific ARM processor. The goal is to have a simulation baseline for
OTAWA's estimates.

This simulator assumes each instruction takes one cycle to execution, plus cache effects.
Currently only an LRU I-cache is supported.

## Running the simulation
See Makefile in subdirectory `example`. Requires ARM compiler.
